## Conditions of Use

By downloading, installing, or using any Custom Pod, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not download or use the Pod. Access to and use of the Pod is granted only to users who accept these Terms.

## Privacy and Data Collection

This Custom Pod does not independently collect, store, or process personal data for its own purposes. No analytics, tracking, or behavioral monitoring is performed by the Pod.

The Pod loads open-source libraries from third-party content delivery networks (CDNs), which may receive standard HTTP request data (such as IP address and browser type) during loading.

Some Pods include an optional AI Assistant feature that, when explicitly configured and used by the user, transmits document or diagram content to a third-party AI service selected by the user. This feature is disabled by default. The Pod provider does not operate or have access to these AI services. Users are responsible for ensuring their use of AI services complies with their organization's data policies. See the Privacy Policy for full details.

Data displayed or processed within the Pod otherwise remains within the Adobe Connect platform. If additional third-party integrations are used alongside the Pod, their respective privacy policies and data practices apply separately.
